# Cloud Neural Voices 

This is a manual test of the highest quality neural voices from [Amazon Polly Neural TTS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/NTTS-main.html) 
and [Azure Cognitive Neural TTS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/text-to-speech) with the following text:

> This little book was written to accomplish something big: economic literacy. This is lots of value at a very low cost.

(from the preface of [How to Think about the Economy: A Primer](https://mises.org/library/how-think-about-economy-primer))
